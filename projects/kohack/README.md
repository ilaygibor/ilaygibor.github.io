## Reflection & Impact
Building a full product from scratch in a single day showed me the value of **team structure under pressure**.  
It pushed me to design efficient APIs and adapt quickly when systems broke mid-competition.  
Beyond the prize, KoHack taught me how to communicate technical ideas clearly — skills that now carry into my robotics leadership and ML research collaborations.
