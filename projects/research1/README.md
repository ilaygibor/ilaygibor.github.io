# [TITLE PLACEHOLDER] — Collagen Segmentation for Permeability Modeling
*Tagline:* Automated collagen-type segmentation in histopathology slides to enable downstream permeability maps.

---

## Overview
[In 4–6 sentences: define the biological problem and why collagen subtypes matter for flow/permeability. Summarize your goal: build a robust pipeline to segment COL-I/III/IV/VI and produce masks consumable by a simulation step. Mention dataset scale (N, sources) and any curation.]

---

## My Role
- Designed end-to-end pipeline (preprocessing → model training → post-processing → export).
- Implemented CNN/thresholding hybrids; tuned hyperparameters with Optuna.
- Built visualization overlays and mask-to-grid mapping for permeability.
- Authored code documentation and experiment notebooks for full reproducibility.

---

## Methods & Tools
- **Languages/Libraries:** Python, TensorFlow/Keras, OpenCV, NumPy, scikit-image, Matplotlib, Optuna
- **Data:** [Describe slide count, stain, image size/resolution, train/val/test split]
- **Core Methods:** color deconvolution, stain normalization, morphological ops, U-Net-style segmentation (or classical threshold pipeline), connected components, mask smoothing, class-specific post-processing
- **Training:** early stopping, k-fold validation, Optuna search on `[lr, encoder depth, loss weights, threshold]`
- **Evaluation:** IoU/Dice per class, confusion matrices, qualitative overlays on held-out slides

## Pipeline at a Glance

### 1) End-to-End Pipeline
![Pipeline Diagram](./assets/pipeline_diagram.png)  
*Explanation:* High-level flow from raw slide → preprocessing → model inference → class-wise masks → post-processing → permeability export. This shows where QC and metrics are computed and how artifacts are filtered.

### 2) Preprocessing & Stain Normalization
![Preprocessing Examples](./assets/preprocessing_examples.png)  
*Explanation:* Examples of color deconvolution and normalization to reduce slide-to-slide stain variance. We also standardize resolution and crop to tissue regions using Otsu/contour detection, removing background.

### 3) Model / Heuristic Architecture
![Model Architecture](./assets/model_arch.png)  
*Explanation:* U-Net-style encoder–decoder with skip connections (if using CNN), or classical threshold-based branches per collagen class. Optuna tunes patch size, thresholds, and loss weights. Augmentations: flips, random hue/sat, elastic deformations.

### 4) Representative Segmentation
![Segmentation Example](./assets/seg_example.png)  
*Explanation:* Pixel-wise predictions per class (COL-I/III/IV/VI) overlaid on the original slide. The legend maps colors to classes; boundary smoothing reduces speckle.

### 5) Overlay Comparison (GT vs Prediction)
![Overlay Comparison](./assets/overlay_comparison.png)  
*Explanation:* Side-by-side of ground truth vs model prediction on held-out data. Note correct capture of fibrous bands (COL-I) and basement-membrane-like structures (COL-IV), with minor over-call on COL-III reduced after morphological clean-up.

### 6) Metrics Snapshot
![Metrics Table](./assets/metrics_table.png)  
*Explanation:* IoU/Dice per class and overall mean. Include k-fold ranges and variability bars if available. Report inference time per megapixel and memory footprint.

## Results
- **Per-class IoU (example):** COL-I `0.__`, COL-III `0.__`, COL-IV `0.__`, COL-VI `0.__`; **mIoU** `0.__` on held-out test set.  
- **Throughput:** `__` Mpx/s on `__` GPU; whole-slide inference ~`__` s.  
- **Robustness:** Performance stable across slides from `__` labs after normalization.  
- **Deliverables:** `paper.pdf`, complete codebase with `requirements.txt`, `run.sh`, and experiment notebooks.

## Conclusion
[2–4 sentences: Summarize what worked best (e.g., stain normalization + U-Net), where errors remain (certain collagen classes or edge artifacts), and how the final pipeline meets the target quality/performance for permeability modeling.]

---

## Impact
[2–4 sentences: Explain how these masks feed downstream permeability simulations, enable faster hypothesis testing for liver tissue modeling, or reduce manual annotation burden. If used in an external simulation tool or study, note that integration and any observed benefits.]
