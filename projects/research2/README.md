# [TITLE PLACEHOLDER] — ML Model Robustness Under Data Corruption
*Tagline:* Evaluating how machine-learning models degrade under systematic noise and dataset distortions.

---

## Overview
[Briefly describe the motivation — why model robustness matters, what kinds of corruptions you studied, and the research goal. Keep it to 3–5 sentences.]

---

## My Role
[Explain what you personally implemented — experiment design, model training, metrics, and analysis.]

---

## Methods & Tools
- **Languages / Libraries:** Python, PyTorch, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib  
- **Dataset:** [Name or type — e.g., CIFAR-10 with synthetic noise]  
- **Corruption Types Tested:** [Gaussian noise, occlusion, rotation, label flips, etc.]  
- **Metrics:** Accuracy drop %, Robustness Score, F1 under noise  
- **Infrastructure:** [GPU/CPU environment, runtime notes if relevant]

---

## Results Summary
- Baseline model accuracy: [X%]  
- Worst-case corruption drop: [Y%]  
- Most resilient architecture: [Model name]  
- Key insight: [Short sentence about what surprised you or what pattern emerged.]
