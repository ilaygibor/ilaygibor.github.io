# [TITLE PLACEHOLDER] — FTC Robotics Leadership & Engineering
*Tagline:* Designing, coding, and leading a competitive robotics team through regional tournaments and public showcases.

---

## My Role
I serve as the **software and autonomous lead** on our FTC robotics team and act as a bridge between mechanical, electrical, and programming sub-teams.  
Responsibilities include:
- Designing and maintaining the full autonomous pipeline (vision + PID control).  
- Writing tele-op and hardware interface code in Java (FTC SDK).  
- Debugging real-time issues during matches and training new members.  
- Coordinating with our build and drive teams to ensure subsystem integration.

## Team Overview
Our team builds fully autonomous robots for the *FIRST Tech Challenge*.  
We prototype in CAD, manufacture parts in-house, and iterate each season on reliability and accuracy.  
This section highlights four key events that shaped our development cycle.

## Code Highlights
The full codebase (autonomous + tele-op) is available here:  
[FTC Autonomous Repository](https://github.com/IlayGibor/ftc-autonomous)  

**Languages & Libraries:** Java (FTC SDK), OpenCV, TensorFlow Lite, PID control, IMU integration.  
**Key Systems:** vision target tracking, trajectory planning, sensor fusion, telemetry logging.

---

## Code Connect – Outreach & Education
I founded **Code Connect**, an after-school program that teaches middle-school students the basics of coding and robotics.  
- Designed a 12-week curriculum (Java fundamentals, sensors, and autonomous logic).  
- Mentored 15 students weekly; built small bots to prepare them for the high-school team.  
- Graduates have since joined our FTC program and won rookie awards.  

---

## Awards & Recognition
- **Dean’s List Finalist** – FIRST Tech Challenge 2025  
- **Regional Qualifiers:** Top Autonomous Performance Award  
- **Community Service Recognition** – STEM Outreach with NYC Mayor’s Office  
- **Mentorship Impact Award** – for Code Connect initiative

## Conclusion & Impact
Our FTC program combines engineering precision with community involvement.  
Beyond competitions, the team’s demos and Code Connect outreach help younger students see how programming translates into real-world machines.  
This experience has shaped how I approach engineering: designing systems that not only perform well but also inspire others to learn.
